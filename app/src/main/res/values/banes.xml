    <string name="Charmed_effect">
        The charmed bane can only be inflicted via a bane attack. Damaging attacks that trigger banes cannot trigger this bane. The charmed bane manifests at two levels: minor and major.
        \n<b>Minor Charm</b> - The target is mentally compelled to become more friendly, only changing their attitude toward you moderately. If they are about to strike you, they will restrain themselves - still angry and hostile, but no longer violent. If they want to help you and are leaning toward trusting you, but have some hesitation because you\'ve just met, then that hesitation goes away.
        \n<b>Major Charm</b> - The attacker chooses whether the major charm is platonic or romantic. If platonic, the bane causes the target to consider the attacker their best friend and one of the most trustworthy and noble people they have met in all their lives. Alternatively, the attacker can choose for this trust and admiration to manifest as romantic love. The target is unable to do anything to plot against the one who afflicted them, and will (at the earliest possible opportunity) tell their charmer of any rumored harm or danger coming their way. The afflicted character becomes immediately suspicious of anyone who speaks ill of their attacker. The target is mentally compelled to like and trust you more, depending on the power level of the bane when invoked.
        \n\n\t<b>Power Level 3</b> - You can Minor Charm creatures of animal level intelligence or lower.
        \n\t<b>Power Level 4</b> - You can Minor Charm creatures of humanoid intelligence. You can Major Charm creatures of animal level intelligence or lower.

Unlike the charmed bane, characters under the effect of domination lose control of their actions. Their minds, however, struggle to regain control of their own body. They cannot take actions of any kind (except thought) unless it is ordered by you. Every action which the attacker orders the afflicted character to perform which is in extreme violation of their nature gives the target a resist roll as a free action to end the effect. The attacker does not gain special access to the target\'s mind and so can only order the character to perform actions that they think the character is capable of. Lastly, each mental order that the attacker gives to the target is a major action. However, the order can be a series of verbal commands, such “Attack enemy X unless someone comes through the door, in which case flee”. The dominated creature will continue to obey the last mental command they were given until you give a new command. Only one such command can be active at a given time.

Initially, you may probe 1 year into the past. For every round that the bane persists, you gain access to an additional year\'s worth of memories. Alternatively, you may choose to access the memories associated with a particular place, object, or event.
        \n\t<b>Power Level 9</b> - This power may target creatures of any intelligence. You gain access to the target\'s current thoughts as well as all of its memories, without limitation by time. Alternatively, you may choose to access the memories associated with a particular place, object, or event.

        You cancel a single boon currently in effect if it is of this bane\'s power level or lower. The invoking power level further impacts the effect as follows:
        \n\t<b>Power Level 1</b> - Cancel a boon of Power Level 1. You can cancel a boon that must be actively invoked. In addition, the target cannot benefit from or have the target boon invoked upon them for 1 minute.
        \n\t<b>Power Level 2</b> - Cancel a boon of Power Level 2.
        \n\t<b>Power Level 3</b> - Cancel a boon of Power Level 3.

        \n\t<b>Power Level 5</b> - Cancel a boon of Power Level 5.
        \n\t<b>Power Level 6</b> - Cancel a boon of Power Level 6. You can cancel a boon that is permanent, passive, or inherent to the target (e.g. the invisibility of a Will o\' Wisp). Effects that would prevent Nullify from being invoked in this way have no effect. In addition, the target cannot benefit from or have the target boon invoked upon them for 1 minute.
        \n\t<b>Power Level 7</b> - Cancel a boon of Power Level 7.

        If the targeted boon covers a large area, you can cancel all of it by targeting any portion of the effect you can see, or multi-targeting a number of 5\' cubes you believe it to be in. If the targeted boon is affecting an area rather than a creature, you roll against the CR of the boon instead of a Resolve defense. The CR is 10 + 2 x the boon\'s invoked power level.

        Persistent damage comes in a number of different variations: physical damage (bleeding from a vital strike), energy damage (lightning, fire, cold, acid, etc.) and entropic damage (necromantic energy), among others. Each variation has its own cure. When that cure is applied with a major action (either by the afflicted character or another), the target receives a resist roll (as a free action) with advantage 1 to end the effect. The GM has the final word on whether a proposed cure can help a given type of persistent damage, but the following examples can help with arbitration:
        \n\tBleeding damage is cured with a successful roll using Learning, Logic, or Creation.
        \n\tLightning damage is cured by a discharge or grounding of the current.
        \n\tCold damage is countered with warmth, heat, or fire.
        \n\tAcid damage is neutralized with alkalizing agents (powder, milk, etc.).
        \n\tFire damage is neutralized with water or smothering.
        \n\tEntropic damage is neutralized with extraordinary or magical healing.
This bane may still be resisted in the usual way of using the resist banes action.
